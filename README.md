# Well Viewer
Python script developed in collaboration with i3S (Porto, Portugal; [www.i3s.up.pt](www.i3s.up.pt)) that creates a Tkinter-based graphical user interface for capturing and automatically anotating images of microplate wells using a *Raspberry Pi 4B SBC* and a *Raspberry Pi High Quality (HQ) C(S)-mount camera* on a trinocular stereo microscope.


It allows users to:
- Record the image of a microplate well (with well position, timestamp and magnification) by clicking on the corresponding position on a schematic representation of the microplate.
- Log selected wells with timestamps and magnification levels.
- Maintain a history of selected wells and saved files.
- See a live preview from the Raspberry Pi camera.

The program starts from a main menu and opens a secondary window to view and interact with the microplate.

## Features
- Supports **96-well**, **48-well** and **24-well** plates
- Graphical selection of wells
- Selectable magnification level (10x, 20x, 30x, 40x, 50x, 63x for our Nikon SMZ800 with 10x eyepieces)
- **Raspberry Pi Camera integration** for image capture
- History log of selected wells and saved files

## Installation
1. **Update the System**

   Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run:
    ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   
3. **Install Dependencies**

   The required libraries can be installed by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-tk python3-opencv python3-pil.imagetk

5. **Clone the Repository**

   If git is not installed, first install it with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git
   ```

   Then, clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leonorribeiroo/WellView
   ```

   Change the directory:
   ```bash
   cd WellView
   ```
   
7. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python3 wellview.py

## Dependencies
Pre-installed with Python:
- Tkinter 
- Bisect 
- datetime
- os
- subprocess

Requires installation on Rasberry Pi:
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow (PIL)

## Usage
1. Enter the *User Name* and *Microplate ID*.
2. Select the *Microplate Type*.
3. Select the *Magnification* (can be changed on the fly in the secondary interface).
4. Click *Start* to open the well selection interface.
5. Click on a well to log its selection and capture an image.
6. Click *Start Preview* to open a live preview from the Raspberry Pi camera.
7. Click *Close Preview* to close the live preview from the Raspberry Pi camera.
8. Click *Back* to return to the primary menu (and change the *Microplate ID*).
9. Click *Finish* to exit the program.


## Notes
Ensure that rpicam-still is installed for image capture.

Images are saved in the user's Pictures directory under:
```bash
~/Pictures/{User}/{Microplate ID}.
